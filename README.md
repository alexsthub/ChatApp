# Chat Server

The chat server is of a microservice architecture was hosted on an EC2 instance that contained docker images for a gateway, messaging
microservice, and other necessary containers such as rabbitMQ, redis, mySQL.

# UI

The UI is very barebones in react.js and is hosted on a separate EC2 instance.

Note: These instances are likely not working anymore. Also, this project was for a class.
